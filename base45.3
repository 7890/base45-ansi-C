.Sh NAME
.Nm base45_encode, base45_decode
.Nd conversion routines
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libbase45
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In base45.h
.Ft int
.Fn base45_encode(char * dstOrNull, size_t *dst_lenOrNull, const unsigned char * src, size_t src_len);
.Ft int 
.Fn base45_decode(unsigned char * dstOrNull, size_t *dst_lenOrNull, const char * src, size_t src_len);
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The base45 format is designed to match the Alphanummeric set of Mode 2
or 0010 of ISO/IEC 18004 Qr codes.
.Pp
These
.Fn base45_encode
will encode a binary buffer 
.Fa src
of size
.Fa src_len
to a 
.Ql \e0 
terminated string. The 
.Fn base45_decode
routine will decode up to
.Fa src_len
bytes from the
.Fa src
buffer back into binary. The buffer
.Fa src
does not need to be 
.Ql \e0
terminated unless
.Fa src_len
is set to
.Ql 0 .
If
.Fa src_len
is set to
.Ql 0
the routine will decode the
.Fa src
until the terminating 
.Ql \e0 . 
.Pp
.Sh RESULTS
The results are  stored in the
.Fa *dstOrNull
buffer that; with the size specified by
.Fa *dst_lenOrNull .
If the length passed is 0,
.Nm base45_encode 
will assume that the buffer pointed at by
.Fa *dstOrNull .
In either case the actual decoded length of the entire string is 
returned in 
.Fa *dst_lenOrNull .
The terminating
.Ql \e0
added by
.Fn base45_encode 
does not count for the length.
If 
.Fa *dstOrNull
is 
.Ql NULL
then the actual results will not be stored.
.Sh RESULTS
The functions will return a non 0 value on error. This is currently only the
case for base45_decode - when it finds an character not in the base45 set
or when the number of characters in the source is not a multiple of 2 and 3.
.Sh HISTORY
This utiltiy was developed as part of the European Health Network
their Digital Green Certificate effort during the 2020-2021 COVID19
Crisis.
.Sh BUGS
Note that this utility is designed for the relatively modests strings that
are encoded into Qr barcodes; and hence does not have a nice streaming 
interface or similar.
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility conforms to ALPHANUMMERIC character set from section 7.44 of
ISO/EIC-18004.  The actual set is 45 characters:
